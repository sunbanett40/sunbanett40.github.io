### Why I Love Electronics
I have always had a deep desire to understand how the world around me works, as a young child I would frequently ask my parents why, until they ran out of answers to give. My fascination with electronics manifested initially as dismantling household electrical appliances (much to my mother’s dismay), in the attempt to understand how they works. 

Once I had matured slightly (but not before I had finished disassembling the house), I shifted my interest to building things. 

System.
Level of abstraction.
Making something.

### Education
I have always had a technical mind and from an early age had an intense fascination with technology. At GCSE, I took a range of technical subjects including Physics, Electronic Products, and Resistant Materials.

For my GCSE Electronics coursework, I created a rotating promotional display. This was the first time I was really able to push myself. Furthermore, this was the first time my project had more than one subsystem that interacted with each other. This was extremely interesting and often challenging as these systems usually would not interact like I expected them to in the circuit simulation software. I found the design and systematic testing highly rewarding.

At A level, I continued with both Physics and Electronics. When the opportunity occurred, I decided to do an EPQ. For this I created a digital thermometer. This taught me invaluable personal skills, such as resilience, perseverance, high standards in documenting, presentation skills and exacting expectations of myself. Furthermore, this motivated me to build on these experiences to develop skills and complex knowledge that I can use on harder problems at the highest levels.

I am now studying EEE at the University of Southampton. University has proved to be challenging and inspiring to me, it has widened my perspective of what Electronics is and how it can be used. An aspect of electronics that has been new to me since starting university has been the programming. Although having limitted experience with Arduino, programming has been a new and enjoyable challenge to me. Since beginnign my course, I have begun to learn the C/C++ programming languages, and the SystemVerilog HDL. In the future, I look forward to using these new skills in solving bigger and greater electronic challenges.

### Hobbies and Interests
Scouting has been incredibly important to me for a long time; it has been instrumental to me in developing strong interpersonal skills. My connection to Scouts continues to be an invaluable way for me to find new people and to enjoy myself, whether it is a serious project or a light-hearted activity. My most memorable experiences were at an activity camp held in Scotland. To complete the week’s programme of activities I had to work closely with a small group, which required both a level of responsibility and emotional intelligence. 

For a long time I have been making scale models. This first started with making scenery for a scale railway I was helping my grandfather build. Since then, I have worked on scale aircraft, scale armour, and wargaming models. Recently, I have been working on Lord of the Rings models, such as this Tom Bombadil (which I really am quite proud of). In the past I have worked on a range of historical and sci-fi based models.

I have a keen interest in 3D modelling and 3D printing. I first encountered 3D printing at an exhibition at the National Science Museum. During my technology based GCSEs I used 3D printing to prototype my coursework projects. Then using my student license for Solidworks, I have continued to use and develop my design skills. My designs have been driven by a desire to solve everyday problems, such as creating a buckle for a broken bag, storage tidies and casings for electrical projects.
