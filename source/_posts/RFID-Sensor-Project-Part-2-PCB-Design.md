### Circuit Diagram
As the majority of the ciruit was designed previously in spice, the Eagle schematic for this file was proivided with those sections filled in. The rest of the file was filled in by importing sympol parts, and setting the model and package.

### PCB Outline
I then created a corresponding board file to the the schematic, and was presented by the following screen.

As we had been provided by the outline of a box that the PCB was to fit in, I modified the shape of the PCB to fit within it. To maximise the space available I made cut outs for the areas where the screw connections of the case will be. I then removed the deadspace under where the buttons will be. Finally, I rounded off the corners so the board is comfortable to pick up and work on once it has been fabricated.
